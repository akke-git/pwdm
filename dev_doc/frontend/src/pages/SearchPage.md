# `SearchPage.tsx` Documentation

**File Path**: `/project/pwdm/frontend/src/pages/SearchPage.tsx`

## Overview

`SearchPage.tsx` is a React functional component intended to house the search functionality for the PwdM application. As of the current version, it acts as a placeholder page, indicating where search features will be implemented.

## Key Features and Components

### 1. UI and Styling

-   **Layout**: Uses an MUI `Container` component with `maxWidth="lg"` to center and constrain the content width. Padding (`py: 4`) is applied vertically.
-   **Content Display**: An MUI `Paper` component (with `elevation={0}`, meaning no shadow) is used to contain the text content.
    -   **Title**: A `Typography` component with `variant="h4"` displays the heading "Search".
    -   **Body Text**: Another `Typography` component with `variant="body1"` displays the placeholder message: "Search functionality will be implemented here."
-   **Font**: The `fontFamily` for the container and typography elements is explicitly set to `'apple gothic'`.
-   **Alignment**: The content within the `Paper` component is center-aligned (`textAlign: 'center'`).

### 2. Functionality

-   Currently, there is no active search functionality implemented in this component.
-   It serves as a static placeholder page for future development of search features.

## Dependencies

-   `react` (React.FC)
-   `@mui/material` (Container, Typography, Paper)

## Future Development

-   This page will eventually include input fields for search queries, logic to interact with an API to fetch search results (likely from the password entries), and UI elements to display these results.
-   Filtering and sorting options might also be part of the future implementation.
